# Learning-R
Learning Language R to help my Daughter

In order to be useful I need to be able to analyse occurence of words et large files using R and packageslike tidyverse 
Let's star with pure R thanks to : https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r

First : install R + R-studio
(To follow the datacamp tutorial I just need a browser)

both R-studio and the online tuto povide a console :

## Operators :
like any console I can do calculations :
7 *9 
2+2
etc...
Exponentiation as usual
2^5
Modulo => in other languages its just % but in R you double : 
28 %% 6

## Assignment :
x <- 42 # x = 42 works as well x[1]
the variable x appears to be an array as well => x[1] gives 42 (arrays or lists start at 1 not at 0)
